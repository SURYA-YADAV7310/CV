<h8 STYLE="COLOR:RED">SARNATH</h8>
<P STYLE="COLOR:GREEN"> Sarnath has been variously known as Mrigadava, Migadāya, Rishipattana and Isipatana throughout its long history. Mrigadava means "deer-park". "Isipatana" is the name used in the Pali Canon, and means the place where holy men (Pali: isi, Sanskrit: rishi) landed.[2]

    The legend says that when the Buddha-to-be was born, some devas came down to announce it to 500 rishis.
    
    Sarnath derives from the Sanskrit Sāranganātha,[3] which means "Lord of the Deer", and relates to another old Buddhist story in which the Bodhisattva is a deer and offers his life to a king instead of the doe the latter is planning to kill. The king is so moved that he creates the park as a sanctuary for deer. The park is active in modern times  </P>
